            <h2>Meaningful Interaction on the web</h2>
            <br>

            This blog post discusses web interaction; a short definition ,how to make a website interactive and the
            importance of an interactive website for art, businesses and for a better user experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            The definition of web interaction is largely contested on what exactly is interaction and the key points
            that
            create a sense of meaningful interaction.
            <br>
            <br>
            Trying to define interaction is a non-trivial task, on the surface it may seem simple. A website is
            interactive
            if it can take in an input from a user and generate an output that is non-random and related to the input or
            series of inputs. This is only a basic understanding on what makes a product or site interactive. Let’s
            stick to
            this basic definition for simplicity.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are three levels of human to computer interaction;
            <ul>
                <li>Not interactive, when an output is not related to previous input.</li>
                <li>Reactive, when an output is related only to one immediately previous input.</li>
                <li>Interactive, when an output is related to several previous inputs and to the relationship between
                    them.
                </li>
            </ul>
            It’s easy to confuse interaction with reaction. To create a site of interaction there are some more
            things to consider. There is a benefit to having an interactive site rather than one which is reactive or
            non-interactive. An interactive site attracts inquisitive users and generates traffic and a pleasant user
            experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            Interactivity is a method of design which a creator can use to bring a degree of meaning to an inanimate web
            page. This helps create a connection between user and site. Designing with interactivity in mind helps the
            creator keep the idea of user journey in mind.
            <br>
            <br>
            But what is meaningful interaction? I would say that a website has achieved meaningful interaction once the
            site
            has been personified. What do i mean? Much like a person that is not just reactive, but interactive, a truly
            meaningful interacting with a website would be when the website displays a personality. The user for one
            second
            may think that this is a real person and not a screen. The users experience has been transformed from
            interacting with a inanimate object to something that feels real.
            <br>
            <br>
            Designing an interactive web page brings life to this inanimate page of information. It gives a sense of
            personality to the page, which changes the dynamic of the user experience from a person using the internet
            to
            someone engaging with this personified object. In a successful case. the website could become a part of its
            user
            even when they are not seeing it.
            <br>
            <br>
            whether it is possible to achieve this truly interactive site currently is unlikely. So how can we instal a
            sense of meaning today? By making your site stand out, making it quirky and unique. By building a connection
            with your users. Humans don't need another human to feel a connection, we can empathies with almost
            anything,
            for
            example; cartoons, trees, flowers and inanimate objects like teddy bears. Even with todays tech we can
            create a
            sense of meaningful interaction, not because it is advanced, but because humans are not.
