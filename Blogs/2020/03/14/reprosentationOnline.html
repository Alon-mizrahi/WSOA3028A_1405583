            <h2>A reflection on online representation</h2>
            <br>
            How does one represent themselves online? To answer this we need to understand what the online space is.
            Much
            like a game space, the internet ,and especially social media, provides an realm that is separate from that
            which
            we live.
            <br>
            Johan Huizinga coined the term ‘the magic circle’, the magic circle describes and area, physical or not, of
            play
            which was metaphorically speaking separate to our world. The rules in this circle were different to the
            rules we
            faced in everyday life, but there were still rules. Huizinga attempted to describe play, what it meant, and
            why
            it was so important.
            <br>
            By this, the internet in some way has elements of play. The rules online are not the same we conform to in
            everyday life. It is an escape from our ‘real’ life. We engage and interact with people much differently,
            often
            in a way that is very uncharacteristic of us (or maybe the true characteristic of us).
            <br>
            With technology becoming a larger and larger part of our everyday lives, we can see these circles colliding.
            Trends on the internet are being acted out physically. People often do things in reality just for the
            opportunity to add it to there online representation. The goals people have for there online lives are
            similar
            to those that they have for their ‘real’ lives.
            <br>
            Keeping this in mind, the way I present myself online, I think, is similar to my offline self. I’m much more
            of
            a consumer than an active poster. On sites where the engagement is primarily with people I engage with in
            ‘real’
            life (such as social media), I am more reserved and closer to my offline self. I think this is because
            although
            the internet is its own magic circle, as it becomes more integrated into our lives, more of our offline
            personality will merge with our online personality. This includes our positive and negative traits, in my
            case
            social insecurities make me more of a consumer. On sites where I am more anonyms to people in my everyday
            life,
            such as reddit, I tend to be more riskier, and engage with more content.
            <br>
            We need to be mindful of our online personality, it can give one great insight into who they are or who they
            want to be. As these two magic circles of different worlds and rules collide, it will be tricky to separate
            the
            two personalities. It is our job to take bits from each one that we think are positive, to make one whole
            complete person, that can navigate both worlds properly.
