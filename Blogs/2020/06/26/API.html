            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            This report covers the authors experience using API’s(Application Programming Interface) that is; the
            implementation, use, implementation process and final thoughts. I will also discuss the effective use of the
            API as well as ways in which the implementation could have been more effective as well as alternative API’s
            that could have been used.
            <br>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            API’s are powerful procedures that allow the access of data and services from an external system. In this
            report I will discuss how I used the Now York times article search API to gather data in a meaningful way
            that could not have been replicated without the use of some form of API. I will speak about alternative
            API’s that could have produced a similar result and why I chose the NYTimes API. I will also speak about the
            Impact that this API has on the website and what it gives the user.
            <br>
            <h3>Body</h3>
            When searching for an API to integrate into my website, it needed to meet certain criteria; it needed to add
            value to my site, it needed to fit the theme of my site, it needed to be free to use and it needed to have
            easy to follow documentation.
            <br>
            I have chosen to use a news related API as fundamentally my website is a radical alternative South African
            media site. This therefore fits the theme of my website. I went through many different API’s before I
            settled on the NYTimes API. I first tried NewsAPI.org which was well documented, free for developers and
            gathered news from multiple sources. Unfortunately after much debugging and tinkering there was a Cross
            Origin Access error that did not allow me to use the API with the unpaid version. I then tried various fact
            checker API’s but they were not well documented. Documentation is important when selecting an API as they
            can be tricky to implement when the documentation is limited. The New York Times API was free to use,
            allowed access to an enormous data source, fit the theme of my site, was very well documented and could be
            used in a way that added meaning to my site by providing users with the newest NYTimes articles relating to
            South Africa.
            <br>
            I implemented the NYTimes search article API with a simple fetch statement. The use of the API required an
            API key which was easy to acquire by signing up on the website. Thanks to the detailed documentation the
            technical implementation was not hard to do. The Search API allows the collection of all NYTimes articles
            relating to a keyword/s that the user inputs. The way that the author implemented the API was to make the
            search term a constant and set it equal to “South Africa”, this implementation will bring 10 current NYTimes
            articles related to south Africa, which the developer could then display on the News Board page.
            <br>
            This is a meaningful implementation of the API as it is very powerful to constantly have current updating
            South African News from a strong reputable source with which a user can instantly link to the sources site
            with a click.
            <br>
            The NYTimes API allows for many different types of data collection, for example; there is also a ‘top
            headlines API’ that will gather global top headlines. I did not use this as I wanted to keep my site
            strictly South African, to further reinforce my character and the sites theme.
            <br>
            Ways in which this implementation could have been improved/changed would have been to allow the user to
            search their own keywords. This would give the user agency one what news they would receive and make the
            page more interactive. However this would have effected the theme of the site as there is no guarantee that
            the news would have been South African related.
            <br>
            <h3>conclusion</h3>
            In conclusion the implementation of the NYTimes API was meaningful and gave powerful information to my site
            and its users. The API fitted the theme of my site and further developed my character and his presence on
            the site. The use of the “South Africa” key word search allows for the article results to be relevant to my
            site. The API implementation was necessary as the same results could not have been achieved without the use
            of some form of API. However the API implementation could have been improved by allowing users to search
            their own keywords, giving my users more agency and meaning when interacting with the site.
