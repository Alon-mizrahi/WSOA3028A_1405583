        <h2>The Implicit Bias Tests</h2>
        <br>
        Everybody has thoughts and feelings that they are not entirely aware of. These unconscious thoughts can be very
        subtle. We all posses certain leanings, mostly known to us, but sometimes they are not. These hidden biases
        affect the way we act and think, in small and large ways.
        <br>
        The Implicit Bias Tests(IBT), is a test which tries to figure out your subconscious leanings. An implicit bias
        refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious
        manner.
        <br>
        I will be talking about the my results from this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
            href=”https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/uk/”> Implicit Bias Test</a> I took and what effect I think
        these implicit biases have on shaping
        the internet. Its important to note that the test is not perfect and outside factors can affect results.
        These
        results are only for educational purposes and interest.
        <br>
        In the IBT regarding age I scored a Strong automatic preference for Young compared to Old. These results
        suggest
        that I subconsciously very much prefer young people to old people. What’s interesting is that consciously I
        would say I have a moderate preference for Young compared to Old.
        <br>
        In the IBT regarding sex I scored a slight automatic preference for Straight people over Gay people. These
        results suggest that I subconsciously prefer straight people to gay people. Again consciously I would say I
        have
        no preference to either group.
        <br>
        The results, although personal, lead to an interesting conclusion; people have subconscious leanings to
        certain
        groups. These leanings can change the way we interact with groups, and in the case of the web, change the
        way we
        design it. For example, if a designer of a product was thinking more about a certain type of person using
        this
        product, then the product will be designed more for that certain person.
        <br>
        In terms of the internet, its clear to see that older people struggle to use and navigate the web like we
        do.
        Even though they weren’t born with it, most older people have had a few years of experience dealing with the
        web
        and still can’t seem to figure it out. This could be due to web designers subconsciously designing sites
        that
        cater to younger people, unintentionally excluding older people from the site.
        <br>
        As a potential future web developer it is essential to constantly be thinking about all types of people how
        would use the site and how to make it accessible to them all. This can be accomplished generally through
        thoughtful and careful UI and UX design.
