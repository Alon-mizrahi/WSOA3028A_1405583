            <h2>The Fundamentals of Education</h2>
            <br>
            2020 and the Covid-19 pandemic have forced the education world to look at itself and the way that these
            institutions educate. Social distancing has broken the traditional institutional education between pupil and
            teacher and forced these institutions to get creative.
            <br>
            Some see it as an opportunity to change and others a hinderance. How affective are these alternative
            educations and what is the implication of the educational world of tomorrow.
            <br>
            A common prediction made when a new invention arises is “This will revolutionize education”, but almost
            always this prediction is wrong. In 1922 Thomas Edison proclaimed, “I believe the motion picture is destined
            to revolutionize our educational system and that in a few years it will supplant largely, if not entirely,
            the use of textbooks.” We know very much that video has not come close to replacing any textbook and is
            definitely not a staple in an educational institute, although it is used, it is seen as a tool and not a
            central point for a good education.
            <br>
            If we look at the world 100 years back the difference in almost every sector has changed immensely. Factory
            works have been replaced by robots. Technology handles the burden of complex work and repetitive tasks have
            been designated to machines. Almost all sectors of the world have changed, except for the educational
            sector. A classroom 100 years ago would look pretty similar to today, maybe with the exception of a
            projector or a smart board. There is still one teach and a group of students of the same age(roughly).
            <br>
            Studies that have presented a group of learners with static images and another group with animations have
            found that, if the content is the same, there is no significant difference in the learners outcome. It seems
            hard to imagine something as powerful as animation not be more effective than static images.
            <br>
            So why hasn’t our educational system changed with the rest of the world. Some say if has to do with the
            bureaucracy of the institution that is unwilling to change. I think the answer is much more complicated than
            that. It has to do with the nature of what education really is. It is not a repetitive task and it is not
            always predictable (that is, a certain input does not mean a certain output). What limits a learner is not
            the tools or the type of information(video or image) given, but something that happens internally in their
            mind. The single most important part of learning is the consolidation of information in the mind.
            <br>
            We need to stop asking what medium is better than the other, and ask how should we use this medium to
            promote an meaningful consolidation for learners. I think videos or remote(online) learning can be just as
            effective, or in same case more so, when the tech is used in the appropriate way.
            <br>

            During todays unprecedented times we are force to evaluate these online education methods, what I’ve noticed
            is that the goal seemed to be to try and mimic the familiar in person lectures with recordings or live
            lectures. The tech was not used to its full potential and was not used in a way that promotes a positive
            learning environment. Understandably things were rushed and to have effective online learning the content
            would need to be catered to the online format. With the appropriate amount of prep time I believe that
            online learning can be an effective method for learners to receive an education.
