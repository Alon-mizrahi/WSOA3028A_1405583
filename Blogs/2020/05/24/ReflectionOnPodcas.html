        <h2>Reflection on Podcast</h2>
        <br>
        Technology and AI in particular can almost seem disconnected from us, like it has a mind of its own. But much
        like anything we create our flaws are put into it as well. When designing tech to be interactive with us,
        designers often are not thinking about all the people that will use the product.
        <br>
        Each designer has a responsibility to ensure that their product does not discriminate against anyone. Designing
        a product that discriminates and/or does not work with a certain race, feeds into the pre-existing systemic
        inequality.
        <br>
        An example of how tech and science can be ‘innocently’ discriminatory; It is not uncommon for medical textbooks
        to only have limited visual examples of only one race, this is often white people. Now if a black person had to
        go to check a skin condition, but the doctor has been ‘trained’ to know what a condition looks like on white
        skin, this can lead to a false diagnosis simple because the patient did not have the same skin colour as the
        text book example.
        <br>
        What do I mean by ‘innocently discriminatory’, well often these discriminations don’t come about by bad
        intention or blatant racism. In the example above there is no indication that the text book creators are racist,
        but rather they didn’t look very far for a variety of visual examples involving different races.
        <br>
        But this ‘innocence’ cannot stay the status quo any longer, creators have the obligation to ensure their tech
        does not discriminate. There are countless stories of facial recognition software that only works with one race,
        or is not accurate with another. These bugs are only there due to a deep rooted pre-existing system that
        excludes most and only includes some. We all hold subconscious biases that affect our work. We need to
        understand who is designing tech/working in science, and who are they designing for.
        <br>
        AI is not inherently racist, but the designers we make them carry implicit biases with them, these go on to
        affect the outcome of their work for certain groups. Creators need to be creating with a larger representation
        in mind.
        <br>
        Science and tech has never been separate from politics and the system. We need to reconcile these two worlds and
        acknowledge their connected past. For example IBM designed tech for Nazi Germany during WWII, and today they are
        still a leading tech company. What does that say about their products and can they ever separate from their
        history?
        <br>
        As a potential future designer or web/software/tech it is my duty to ensure that my implicate biases do not
        affect my work and that my product works for all
