        <h2>The Ethics of tech</h2>
        <br>
        We create something, but we don’t always stop and consider why?
        <br>
        As the world becomes more and more connected and dependant on technology. New software and tech spreads across
        the globe at a rate never seen before. This has changed the way people live in an unthinkable way. There are
        some moral questions that need to be answered.
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Is it the role of tech and software companies to think about the ethical affect a new piece of
                software or
                tech has on the world
            </li>
            <li>
                Should developers develop and it is the role of government and outside bodies to deal with the moral
                implications and set legislation and law.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        If we choose option 1, the rate of new tech and software will probably increase, potentially driving us into a
        more developed world faster. But this relies on efficient and an moral government, which is not always the case.
        <br>
        If we choose option 2 the rate of new tech and software will take a hit, but the ratio of tech that positively
        affects the world to tech that negatively affects the world will increase.
        <br>
        I believe it is the developers responsibility to see the true power and uses of their invention. As they say,
        ‘Once something is on the internet it’s never leaving’. I think this applies to new tech as well. If somebody
        demonstrates it is possible to achieve something, people will join on and create their own.
        <br>
        I do think however that government and outside bodies should still be involved for a full moral and ethics
        review of something that is deemed powerful.
        <br>
        I will use various tweets and articles about a software developer who went through this same thought, as an
        example to highlight my point.
        <br>
        Joseph Redmon is the creator of a software called YOLO(You Only Look Once). YOLO is an object detection
        algorithm, it can detect real life objects using a camera together with this software. Redmond announced that he
        had stopped his computer vision research to avoid enabling potential misuse of the tech, in particular he had
        concerns with, “military applications and privacy”.
        <br>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" tw-align-center>
            <p lang="en"> dir="ltr">I stopped doing CV research because I saw the impact my work was having. I loved the
                work but the military applications and privacy concerns eventually became impossible to ignore.<a
                    href="https://t.co/DMa6evaQZr">https://t.co/DMa6evaQZr</a></p>&mdash; Joe Redmon (@pjreddie) <a

        </blockquote>
        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <br>
        The YOLO project is well recognised and even received a OpenCV People’s Choice Award. It is no easy decision to
        short stop a project. It is important to understand and evaluate the impact of your work when realising it into
        the world. In this case Redmond decided the YOLO project can do more harm than good. In this case I agree with
        Redmon. Although someone else will do this work in the future. Redmon has delayed these privacy breaches and
        military uses by some years. At least in the future we can aim to have more laws and legislation to guide the
        world into a more moral tech driven world.
        <br>
        Redmon said he felt humiliation for ever believing “science was apolitical and research objectively moral and
        good no matter what the subject is.” Although we cannot delay our tech advancements forever. It is up to the
        developers to make a moral call to withhold tech and software, if necessary, until the there are proper laws
        governing the moral and ethical use of a certain tech.
        <br>
        As a story about Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the inventor of RADAR, goes; Watson-Watt got a glimpse of a less
        popular application for the technology he helped develop - when he was pulled over for speeding by a policeman
        using a radar gun. He said, “My God, if I'd known what they were going to do with it, I'd have never have
        invented it!”
        <br>
        We cannot always tell what our contributions will be used for. The power something holds for good, holds an
        equal power for evil.
