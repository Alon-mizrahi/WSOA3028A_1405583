            <h2>Information Geographies</h2>
            <br>
            The internet is a global archive of collective thoughts of humanity past present and future. It is an
            endless
            stream of information build and created by various humans around the globe. At least on the surface it is.
            <br>
            Since the invention of nuclear weapons man has no physical limitations on the battle field. But to assure we
            don’t mutually destroy one another, people use a different tool to fight and spread messages. Information is
            the
            new weapon, and the internet the means of which it spreads.
            <br>

            The internet has been a wonder of making a connected globe, where news facts and information can reach
            everyone,
            and on the same boat so can lies and deceit. Its easy to feel like the representation of people on the web
            is
            somewhat equal, that amongst normal people we all have a similar reach as to how far we can spread
            information.
            <br>

            The internet is the single largest shaper of our world. Being able to for groups and spread ideas globally
            has
            accelerated the growth and development of humanity, both technologically and politically. It is important to
            understand the geographies of the web, that being representation of consumption and creation, and try
            understand
            why and how we can create a more equal , and in turn, free web. We need to understand who has the power of
            information and who is consuming that information.
            <br>

            We will look at data driven figures and maps that highlight a clear inequality of internet users and
            creators.
            All data has been taken from Graham et al’s “Toward a study of information geographies”. We say
            ‘Geographies’ as
            you will see on the map data internet users and consumers have been grouped by their geographical location.
            We
            can see trends of close areas and the difference between the northern and southern hemispheres.
            <br>
            ‘different groups of people [are] trying to impose different narratives on informational augmentations’, The
            core of this paper is to try and understand what these narratives are and who is imposing them. The authors
            speak about uneven access and uneven participation and representation. The internet is still a technology at
            the
            end of the day, it requires infrastructure, money and equipment to access. Different countries have
            different
            levels of these necessary things, this leads to the under representation of certain groups and the over
            representation of others.
            <br>
            The authors highlight the idea that if someone or somewhere is not connected to the internet they are
            essentially invisible, not only physically, but their ideas and philosophies are also lost.
            <br>
            “The geographic distribution of information… has long been a key means of control and power formation”, the
            idea
            that information is power, and those that control it are in control. The paper also sets out to find who is
            on
            control. “… digital age offers a potentially radically different political economy of information”, who
            controls
            this political economy, and who is getting left out in the new world‘?
            <br>
            There are three key factors of geographies we must look at;
            <br>
            1)Access and enablement:physically who has access and who does not.
            <br>
            <img class="articleimgs" src="../../../BlogImages/infogeog1.jfif" alt="">
            <br>
            This map shows us the effective internet penetration and the number of internet users of a region, the
            larger an
            area the more users, the darker a country the higher its penetration. It is important to note the southern
            half
            of Africa, and how little internet penetration there is, and the amount of internet users.
            <br>
            Cost is another important aspect of access to the web, the map below shows the cost of broadband as a % of
            the
            average income.
            <br>
            <img class="articleimgs" src="../../../BlogImages/infogeog2.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            We can see Africa has the highest cost of broadband as for what people can afford. This harshly limits
            internet
            access to the majority. We will see how this affects representation later on.
            <br>
            2)Participation:
            <br>
            To understand internet participation, the authors looked at two major sites(Github users and Wikipediae
            edits)
            and domain names. These give an idea of the disproportionate creators on the internet.
            <br>
            The map below shows the distribution of domain names across the globe. The larger the bubble the more domain
            names registered, the darker the bubble the larger the internet population.
            <br>
            <img class="articleimgs" src="../../../BlogImages/infogeog3.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            Its very clear to see who owns the most domain names and who controls very little. Again we can see that
            African
            participation is shockingly low. Do we even exist on the internet, when we are over run by the rest of the
            world?
            <br>
            I will now look at Wikipedia as I believe it is one of the most important websites to ever exist. The map
            below
            shows the number of Wikipedia edits by country.
            <br>
            <img class="articleimgs" src="../../../BlogImages/infogeog4.jfif" alt="">
            <br>
            Wikipedia has a page on every politician and every major event in history. We need to understand who is
            writing
            and construing information about these things. Who will tell the world our history, and who will have the
            power
            of information describing our politicians to us. They say history is written by the victor, maybe that is
            true.
            <br>
            3)representation:
            <br>
            The authors look at how geography is represented geographically. They use three metrics: Google Search,
            OpenStreetMap, and Freebase and Geonames.
            <br>
            The data below represents the ‘Distribution of internet users and platforms of representation’
            <br>
            <img class="articleimgs" src="../../../BlogImages/geoinfo5.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            We can see here how representation is linked to population. It is not necessarily true that a higher
            population
            will lead to increased internet representation. It is clear to see Europe has one of the highest
            representation
            on each of the 4 sites yet is one of the smallest populations. North America also echo’s this pattern. While
            Africa makes up a slither of internet representation despite having a larger population than Europe and
            North
            America.
