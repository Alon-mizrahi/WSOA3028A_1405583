            <h2>Reflections on readings</h2>
            <br>  
            In the creation of the world wide web. It was dreamed up to have certain ideals. But many people have through of what a world with an accessible resource of resources would look like long before the web was around.
            The library of babel describes a world of filled with endless books, and every combination of written letter possible. The people of this world struggle to understand most of the books and some deem them as nonsense. There is a chaos and order withing the knowledge of the books
            Much like the web today there is a plethora of ‘useful’ and ‘non-useful’ information, it exists and no one should have the right to determine what is ranked higher than what, and no one does.
            Unlike the web where the information is published. In Babel the information just exists and cannot change, however it is total and all encompassing
            In Babel the base of information is the same, the same characters used, everyone in the story could understand the books. This can be linked to the accessibility of the internet. The internet is made to be user friendly.
            In Babel people devote themselves to find meaning in this knowledge, I think this is similar to information on the internet. More information doesn’t mean a more meaningful life. In many cases it’s the opposite.
            People in Babel try destroy certain books to no avail, but like the web we can never get rid of the information that holds.

            In The Garden of forking, I think there are two messages that can be taken that relate to the world wide web. The first on is of web structure. The maze and the book that seems to be out of time and sync, is similar to web pages jumping around and the connectivity of these timeless pages. Time on the internet is not a bound that constrains. For everything on the internet is timeless and eternal.
            The second is of philosophical value, In the story the man we follow has the answer to a centuries old riddle that’s plagued his mind revealed, yet he still chooses the darker path.
            Knowledge does not lead to sole good or evil, but both.
            <br>
            As we may think, describes Bush’s view of what the future will hold for the human race.
            He speaks about the change in technology as things become cheaper to manufacture and more reliable. He speaks about how we have enhanced our physical abilities with machines and the next step is to enhance our minds. He describes and easily accessible universal record that is a collection of other records. This is exactly what the internet is. He predicts the way information is stored will change. Which it has. Even though we still rely on text and images heavily, there are new formats that are taking over. There will be a device that can access this total record and it will be easily accessible.
