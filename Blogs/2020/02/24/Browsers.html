        <h2>What is a Browser and how does it affect the way we use and interact with the web?</h2>
        <br>
        To understand how the browser we use affect us today we need to first understand their history, what they do and
        how users interact with them.
        <br>
        An internet browser is a software that allows you to view web pages. It is the software that decrypts the code
        and information on any web page or site and displays it in a way we can understand, such as text and graphics.
        <br>
        Browsers weren’t always so colourful and easy to use. In fact the first browser was entirely text based. It was
        called ‘World Wide Web’ browser, it was released in 1990 and developed by CERN. It was quite a tricky thing to
        use. Follow <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href=“https://worldwideweb.cern.ch/”> this link</a> to
        give it a try. This link
        will take you to a World Wide Web browser simulation. Try search something in google.
        <br>
        Before more graphical and advanced browsers, to access the internet wasn’t such a trivial task. It definitely
        was not user friendly and accessible to the non-tech savvy.
        <br>
        With the introduction of the easier to use and more graphical Mosaic browser, released in 1992, non-tech savvy
        people had more access to the internet.
        <br>
        This sudden ease of use lead to more and more users going on the web. Companies started to compete for users to
        surf the web with their browser. This was the start of the browser wars. The browser wars was the competition of
        companies such as Microsoft and Netscape competing for majority of internet users to use their browser. Why?
        Well browsers are the code decryptors of the web, and each browser decrypts code differently. Holding majority
        users would change the way the internet developers would develop websites.
        <br>
        Today browsers are powerful tools that can give you a customized efficient and personal browsing experience,
        automatically doing certain tasks for you, by learning the way you browse.
        <br>
        Part of the power of the internet is its accessibility, thanks to browsers today that are designed around the
        user, almost anyone with a device can browse the internet with relative ease. Browsers they way they decrypt
        information and the way they present that information to us , are directly responsible for bringing the internet
        to the people.
