            <h2>About me</h2>
            <br>
            My Name is George J. Ridley
            I was born in the UK in 1953, but my parents moved to SA in 1957.
            When we first moved we lived in Port Elizabeth, but later I relocated to Johannesburg after school in search of a job, and I’ve been here ever since.
            In terms of education I belive in a hands on approche. I have a matric certificate, I never attended university for a variety of reasons, although I had a strong interest in the sciences. I have self-taught myself many skills through the labours I’ve done in my life, and have spent countless hours doing research on electronics and physics.
            At this ripe old age of my life I find myself some what of an expert in these fields. I’m strong at math and I’m making headway in coding and software.
            All these skills I learnt through experience and time.
            I work in a mess that would confuse anyone. Notes and papers all over the show, but I know what I’m doing, people often think I’m crazy to work in the mess I do.
            <br>
            They say Johannesburg is the centre of South Africa, and that it is. I been living in Johannesburg for 47 years, and there’s something that’s keeping me here. Something dark is happening in this centre of the country and it affects us all. The government is hiding something from us.
            Have you ever read something in the news that the government covered up and though,” well that’s a bad excuse”? well, it’s because that excuse is not the truth. I found the truth, and I’m here to share it with those that will listen.
            There is a higher power out there, and you need to know. You can’t trust the system anymore. You can’t trust your mind anymore. It’s all lies.
            <br>
                This website exists for me to share the things I have found, though digging and research. I’ve uncovered many secrets hidden in the dark of Johannesburg and you need to know.
            <br>
            I may sound crazy, but that’s because the truth is beyond your wildest nightmares.
