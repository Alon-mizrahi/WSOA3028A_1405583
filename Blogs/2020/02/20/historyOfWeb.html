            <h2>The standardization of Java script</h2>
            The World wide web, when created had a goal to revolutionize the world. Change the way information was sent
            and
            received.
            These goals included;
            <ul>
                1. Accessibility, no permission from an authority is needed to access or publish onto the web
                <br>
                2. Non-discrimination based off of wealth
                <br>
                3. Bottom up design. The code used should be accessible and user friendly to encouraging maximum
                participation and experimentation.
                <br>
                4. In order for the web to work, the computers need to speak the same language to communicate
                <br>
                5. There had to be a consensus oh practices, which came from the W3C.
            </ul>
            Iâ€™m going to focus on points 3,4,5. And how the use and development of java script is what it is for a these
            reasons above.
            Why is the standardization of browsers significant? The web is a record of records. As important as it is to
            view these records, it is equally important to contribute to them. Having browsers decode web pages
            differently
            led to major complications for developers and users who wanted to access a web page.
            <br>
            Back in the day different browsers decoded web pages differently. This would lead to there being a browser
            monopoly and issues for developers to create web pages that were universal and can be seen properly by all
            browsers.
            Java Script is a high level programming language making it very accessible to the public. It's simple to use
            as
            it uses language closer to what we speak than what computers understand. This contributes to the
            accessibility
            of the web, allowing non proficient coders to create and add to the webs resources.
            <br>
            There were multiple conferences and boards set up to deal with this issue. Many companies cooperated with
            these
            practices, some did not.
            Netscape, a company that ran a browser submitted JavaScript to ECMA International, as the starting point for
            a
            standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the release of the first
            ECMAScript language.
            <br>
            Today java script is a full and strong language with a wide variety of uses. It is stable and well adopted
            by
            internet developers. Although it is not a perfect language, it brings us closer to seeing an ideal world
            wide
            web.
