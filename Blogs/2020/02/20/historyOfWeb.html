            <h2>The standardisation of Java script</h2>  
            The World wide web, when created had a goal to revolutionise the world. Change the way information was sent and received.
            These goals included;
            <ul>
                1.	Accessibility, no permission from an authority is needed to access or publish onto the web
                <br>
                2.	Non-discrimination based off of wealth
                <br>
                3.	Bottom up design. The code used should be accessible and user friendly to encouraging maximum participation and experimentation.
                <br>
                4.	In order for the web to work, the computers need to speak the same language to communicate
                <br>
                5.	There had to be a consensus oh practices, which came from the W3C.
            </ul>
            Iâ€™m going to focus on points 3,4,5. And how the use and development of java script is what it is for a these reasons above.
            Why is the standardisation of browsers significant? The web is a record of records. As important as it is to view these records, it is equally important to contribute to them. Having browsers decode web pages differently led to major complications for developers and users who wanted to access a web page.
            <br>
            Back in the day different browsers decoded web pages differently. This would lead to there being a browser monopoly and issues for developers to create web pages that were universal and can be seen properly by all browsers.
            Java Script is a high level programming language making it very accessible to the public. It's simple to use as it uses language closer to what we speak than what computers understand. This contributes to the accessibility of the web, allowing non proficient coders to create and add to the webs resources.
            <br>
            There were multiple conferences and boards set up to deal with this issue. Many companies cooperated with these practices, some did not.
            Netscape, a company that ran a browser submitted JavaScript to ECMA International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the release of the first ECMAScript language.
            <br>
            Today java script is a full and strong language with a wide variety of uses. It is stable and well adopted by internet developers. Although it is not a perfect language, it brings us closer to seeing an ideal world wide web.
