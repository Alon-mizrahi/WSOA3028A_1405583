            <h2>The Importance of Meta Data</h2>
            <br>
            Firstly, what is meta data? Meta data, when speaking about web design, is data that provides more
            information
            about other data. For example this can be data that’s relevant in describing what a page on the web contains
            but
            is not necessary to have rendered on the page. This doesn’t mean its not used.
            <br>
            So who is this meta data for?
            <br>
            To answer this we must first think about who uses the world wide web. The answer to that is us, people, and
            bots. Bots are make up a large part of internet users and page visitors. The are useful tools that try and
            understand what is on a page. But these bots don’t necessarily understand plain text and words. They largely
            use
            meta data that is provided on the site to understand what exactly the site is about.
            <br>
            A very important part of a web site is its viewers and users. A web page is designed to be used and seen.
            Meta
            data is used to helps bring websites to the people searching for them.
            <br>
            So we can see that meta data matters when building a web page. Meta data contains the necessary information
            for
            search engines to understand what’s on your page and suggest it to a user when they search for something
            similar.
