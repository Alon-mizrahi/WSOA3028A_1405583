        <h2>Conspiracy theories and what we can learn from them</h2>
        <br>
        Conspiracies are far and wide. Spread through the world no matter what corner you live on. They can range from
        mild, to outright crazy. But why do people seem to cling onto these conspiracies? Over a third of Americans
        believe that global warming is a hoax, that’s a lot of people, even when science and scientist have been adamant
        that global warming is real.
        <br>
        People feel a need to find truth and answers. It is no secret that the unknown scares us. It is something that
        evolution has built into our brains. Our ancestors who would walk into the unknown would often not return back.
        And so we learnt, the unknown is dangerous.
        <br>
        For example we can look at flat earthers. It may seem obvious to us that the earth is in fact not
        flat(spoilers), but in reality it is purely obvious since we are told from a young age, everyone seems to agree,
        and the maths works. But to someone who is not scientific and relies on visuals to understand the world. The
        world is flat. That is their reality. The desire to seek an answer is so strong, to eliminate the unknown that
        we will believe almost anything.
        <br>
        We all think we are so smart and know the truth, but things are often more complicated than we think. I am
        almost 100% positive that if anyone had to watch a documentary on how the mon landing was faked we would all be
        somewhat convinced, or at least be in more doubt about the truth.
        <br>
        Ordinary people are not different from a conspiracy theorist. Our minds work the same, see things we don’t
        understand and we try find answers that make sense to us. We all have this instinct. The real difference is that
        we hold onto different ‘truths’, maybe our truths aren’t so global(such as flat earth, global warming hoax) but
        we all look into the unknown and grab the only bit of light we can find. Maybe we have a conspiracy about our
        friends, maybe we don’t believe they have our best interests at heart. These are fundamentally all conspiracies.
        <br>
        We can learn a lot from conspiracy theorists, about the nature of humans and about the nature of ourselves. We
        are all scared and lonely. Its not surprising we cling to the only things that make sense to us, even when the
        world tells us we are wrong
