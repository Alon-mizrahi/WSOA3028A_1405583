        <h2>UI and UX as a Tool to Guide the User</h2>
        <br>
        The user interface(UI) and the user experience(UX) are essential components of any product service or system. We
        design products though the UI and UX lens to have and end product that is centred around the user and the user
        interaction of that product.
        <br>
        UI covers the outer works of the product that the user interacts with. It encompasses the visuals and layout and
        styling of the product.
        UX is similar to UI except it also asks the question, ”How would this design make the user feel and what
        reaction would it elicit?”. It attempts to predict the needs of potential users.
        <br>
        Is there one way designers should design the UI and UX? Is it all about efficiency, conveying the message and
        pushing a call to action. I don’t think so. UI and UX can shape how a user interacts with your creation, but
        sometimes it can be beneficial to your product to have seemingly bad UI and UX design. For example, say you were
        designing an art piece webpage, and it would be beneficial to the art piece to install a sense of confusion in
        the user. The artist can use UI and UX thought to design the page with traditionally bad UI and UX to install
        this feeling of confusion.
        <br>
        For my Web page I am going to attempt something similar. I need to sell the idea that my webpage was created by
        a delusional old man who believes in lizard people. If I presented my page very modern and cleanly designed, it
        would break the illusion. I also want the user to feel they are back in time when using the webpage, that is to
        say to give the user a genuine 90’s user experience. I also want to up the call to action to highlight the
        obsessive nature of George.
        <br>
        Its no secret that the users experience of the internet wasn’t the best n the 90’s. Pages where messy, buttons
        weren’t obvious and menus were convoluted. So to achieve my goals, I’m going to have to use what I know about
        good UI and UX design and do almost the opposite.
        <br>
        I would argue that this is still good UI and UX design, because it was still designed with the user and the
        users experience in mind, the only difference is that I don’t want the user to have a fully positive experience,
        and that in turn will add to a more immersive and convincing user experience.
