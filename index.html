                <h2 id="Index1"> Johannesburg in the Dark</h2>

                I’m sitting here in the dark, my laptop out and a candle lit, knowing that in this darkness lies
                something
                unimaginable. There is nothing that should be kept secret, and I will risk everything to expose the
                truth.
                So why am I in the dark. Load shedding of course, every South African knows load shedding very well, and
                we
                all know the terrible attempts at excuses that we are fed from the government.
                First, let’s debunk the deceitfulness of Eskom;
                <br>
                South Africa is one of the larges exporters of coal in the world. Exporting tons upon tons of
                high-quality
                coal around the clock. South Africa is the main coal exporter to the rest of Africa, and a huge exporter
                to
                China. Now, I don’t know about you but to me that doesn’t sound like we are lacking coal by any means to
                run
                our country.
                <br>
                You may have also heard the term, “wet coal” recently being used as an excuse for the load shedding.
                This is
                obviously a cover up of the truth and such a poor one at that.
                <br>
                With 27 operational power plants generating over 95% of the country's electricity and over 40% of all
                electricity on the African continent South Africa is one of the ten largest power utilities in the
                world.
                So, if we have enough coal, there is evidence of Eskom lying to the public and our power plants have the
                capacity to supply enough power. What’s really going on??
                <br>
                Eskom is purposefully diverting power from the country, to power something not of this world,
                something of grave consequences to us all. And they are using the extra coal sales money to fund it.
                Have you ever heard of the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) or the South African Large Telescope (SALT)? Me
                neither until I did a little digging. Isn’t it odd, that in a country with a huge unemployment rate and
                a
                starving population the government decided to lay out €1.8 billion to develop these space communication
                and
                observation devices?
                <br>
                Why would Eskom do this? Seems odd doesn’t it, well not if the powers in government depended on it to
                survive and complete their mission.
                <br>
                So, who are these powers, well they are of course…

                The government is always struggling to get things right and maybe that's because they're still
                learning
                or
                maybe the people on top have different objectives to us. I think it's fair to say that the
                government
                has
                made many questionable decisions in the past. Its no secret that corruption lives and breathes
                within
                the
                government, but there is a level of corruption that is interstellar and unconceivable.
                <br>
                There are Lizard people hiding in the government, hiding in powerful positions. Its hard to spot
                them,
                but
                when you do, everything falls in place. Our government has been compromised. What
                they are here to do, I haven’t figured out yet. All I know for certain is that we are not safe
                anymore.
                They
                are here and they are up to something, something big and it’s coming sooner than we think...

                <h2 id="Index4"> The betrayal of Nik Naks</h2>
                Lets start from the end. Nik Naks, the most popular snack in South Africa, how did this come to be? In
                the 2000’s the Nik Naks mascot was change due to concerns over the racially prejudicial nature of the
                original image featuring a stylized Kaapse Klopse minstrel. This mascot was a symbol of the tool for
                evil that Nik Naks were.
                <br>
                <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
                    href="http://www.ropeofsand.com/2014/04/29/niknaks-a-history-of-racism/">This article</a> discuss a
                lot about the
                racist history of Nik Naks, but it misses the real dirty that these seemingly innocent maze snacks
                covered up.
                <br>
                Now lets go to the beginning. The Simba chip company has been around since 1957, and to still be
                dominating the snack market is no coincidence. It’s no surprise Simba had to make a deal with the devil
                to be where they are today.
                <br>
                Nik Naks were released in 1972 after much development from Simba. And were pushed hard into the market.
                <br>
                We need to understand the south African environment during this time, to try comprehend what exactly
                went down.
                <br>
                Up until the 60’s the government had successfully managed to subdue all outspoken on the apartheid
                regime. In 1968 the government received intel on a growing group on black workers that had plans to
                protest and were massing up numbers quick. In response the government established The Bureau of State
                Security, also known as BOSS. BOSS was headed up by Hendrik van den Bergh, who’s as murky as the history
                of BOSS. The main aim of BOSS was to monitor national security, as well as to recognize any potential
                threats to the South African state.
                <br>
                van den Bergh knew the government were outnumbered by the fast growing anti-apartheid movement and any
                violent attack would spin the country into chaos. If the situation was left, then the regime risked
                collapsing.
                <br>
                This led to the partnership of the Simba Chips company and BOSS.
                <br>
                BOSS incentivized Simba, with tax reductions to produce a new snack that could be pushed into areas of
                black workers and townships.
                <br>
                Upon consumption of this snack, a toxin called Staphylococcus, that attacks white blood cells would
                start
                working on its consumer. The idea was to subdue someone who ingests the snack by weakening their immune
                system leading to them becoming sick more frequently and experiencing a loss of energy.
                <br>
                The strategy worked for a long time, delaying the inevitable violence and protests by at least a decade.
                <br>
                In the mid 1980’s, Simba pulled with BOSS when things started to not look good for the current
                government. Simba, changed their recipe for Nik Naks and covered almost all connection to BOSS, like
                nothing ever happened.

                But this begs the question, what is in our food today??

                The world keeps churning, everything is about ‘new’, ‘better’, ‘faster’. The fat cats on top don’t care
                about the bottom feeders as long as they get their ‘progress’. But this time they have gone to far!
                These scum are killing us all in the name of ‘progress’. How far are they willing to go?? They have been
                raising new 5G towers by the week, the idiots. Murdering millions just so they can browse the internet
                faster. Killing innocent people just to look at their Instagram and their Facebook.
                <br>
                They say radio waves are false, but I’ve got proof for you. Have you ever been to the doctor and got an
                x-ray? The first thing the doctor says is, ”don’t worry, this is completely safe.”, the next thing that
                happens is the doctor moves to a different room hides behind a thick glass shield and seels you in,
                probably because ‘its safe’. HA! That’s the last time they fool me.
                <br>
                This is the same situation but on a mass scale. They say its safe, but they put the towers far away from
                them leaving those beneath them to suffer.
                <br>
                Want more proof? The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it will commit up to $100 million
                for the global response to the 2019 novel coronavirus. That’s a lot of money, maybe its because they are
                so generous or maybe its because they have a guilty heart, and are trying to get rid of any suspicion.
                But they cant fool us.
                <br>
                We’ve seen an increase in Covid-19 cases where ever they put these towers, it is not a coincidence. It
                is sick, these people don’t care. Huawei deployed a 5G network in the new hospital in Wuhan that was
                built to manage the coronavirus. They thrive on the pain of others as we can see here. The big
                corporations don’t care.
                <br>
                You need to stay away from the towers, its not safe anymore. We are on our own, the mainstream media
                dismisses us, they think we are crazy. Can’t they see we are trying to help. We are doomed unless people
                start to open their eyes.
