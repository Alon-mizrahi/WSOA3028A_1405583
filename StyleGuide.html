        <h2>Style guide and inspiration</h2>
        <br>
        <article class="rndmtxt" style="color: darkslateblue;">
            This is guide on the style and direction the website is heading. I've included images and links to external
            websites that have given me
            inspiration.
            <br>
            The website will be a retro 90's themed website. I have chosen this theme as I think it complements my
            character choice. The 90's theme highlights the out of date views and age of my character. It gives the
            illusion that this website has been up for many years and the character has not changed it with the times,
            as
            he himself has not changed. I think it also gives the effect that the character is weary of new technologies
            as
            hes not keeping up with cutting edge tech. The out of date style emphasizes my characters how out of touch
            he is
            with the rest of South African society.
            <br>
            I've taken inspiration from a these websites below;
            <br>
            <h3>captain Marvel</h3>
            <img class="articleimgs" src=".//style guide images/captainmarvelhome.jpg">
            <br>
            I like the layout of this page and mine is similar. I think their use of GIF's really capture the energy of
            a
            90's website. The layout is simple and easy to follow for the user as it is one single page.
            <br>

            <br>
            The colour palette works well and gives the right vibe. I like the interactivity of this site.

            <h3>Poolside FM</h3>
            <img class="articleimgs" src=".//style guide images/poolsidemainpage.jpg">
            <br>
            I like the styling of the old windows buttons as well as the colour pallet of this website. I might attempt
            to
            do something similar with my buttons and fonts as well.
            <br>

            <br>
            This website features a mix of still images and short videos, all have a 90's theme to them. The use of
            pastel
            colours is also a good choice that I may use. I also think the pixel art style is a direction I want to go.

            <h3>Windows93.net</h3>
            Windows93 is a simulation of windows93, you can open all the apps and programs on the page and the
            interactivity
            of it is great. the page uses classic 90's windows art and sprites, unlike the captain marvel webpage that
            feels
            more like a modern take on a 90's webpage. I would like my webpage to feel more genuine 90's than a modern
            retro
            website. A large portion of the websites interactive buttons don't seem to do much or anything, which I
            like. I
            think to make my page feel more genuine there has to be noticeable design flaws where the sacrifice of clean
            and
            efficient user experience adds to an increase in that 90's webpage user experience. this can be seen in the
            captain marvel webpage as well, where somethings that look like they should be buttons are not. The lake of
            obviousness is part of the website feel.
