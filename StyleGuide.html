    </header>

    <article>
        This is guide on on the style the website is heading. I've included external websites that have given me
        inspiration.
        <br>
        The website will be a retro 90's themed website. I have chosen this theme as I think it complements my
        charactures choice. the 90's theme highlights the outof date views and age of my characture. It gives the
        illusion that this website has been up for many years and the characture has not changed it with the times, as
        he himself has not changed. I think it also gives the effect that the characture is weary of new technologies as
        hes not keeping up with cutting edge tech.
        <br>
        ive taken insporation from a few websites.
        <br>
        <h3>captain Marvel</h3>

        <br>
        I like the layout of this page and mine is simillar. I think their use of GIFs really capture the energy of a
        90's website. The layout is simple and easy to follow for the user, it's one single page.
        <br>

        The colour palette is iconic 90's and.......

        <h3><a href="https://www.marvel.com/captainmarvel/" target="_blank">Captain Marvel Webpage</a></h3>

        <h3>Poolside FM</h3>

        <br>
        I like the styling of the old windows buttons as well as the colour pallet of this website.
        <br>

        <br>
        This website features a mix of still images and short videos, all have a 90's theme to them. The use of pastal
        colours is also a good choice that i may use. I also think the pixly art style is a direction i may go.
        <br>
        <h3>Windows93.net</h3>
        Windows93 is a simulation of windows93, you can open apps and programs on the page and the interactivity of it
        is great. In terms of style I haven't taken any specific insporation from this websight. However it does have
        the
        interactivity that I would like to have on my page.
