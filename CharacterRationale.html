    <h2>Character rationale</h2>
    <br>
    George J Ridley was born in the UK in 1953, but his family moved to Port Elizabeth in 1957, to be with family. The
    Ridley family are a middle-low class family. George’s father was a factory worker.

    George was always getting in trouble at school. Getting suspended multiple times, and almost expelled another. It
    seemed as through he was fighting with the institution. But he was a bright boy and an obsessive hard worker. If he
    didn’t hate and rebel against his school he might have done much better.
    <br>
    After graduating with a matric, his parents wanted him to go to college. But George had no interest in such things.
    Although smart, he was better working with a hands on approach, and he didn’t really trust the university system. At
    age 18, 1971 he left home to go live in Johannesburg.

    The difference between apartheid enforcement in Johannesburg and PE was uncanny. Johannesburg being the centre of
    south Africa the political climate of the city was not so stable, and growing less so each month. The transition was
    too much for George. He saw horrible things.
    <br>
    George was a stubborn boy, and refused to leave. He became the apprentice of an electrician who was his father’s
    friend. George worked and learned a lot. He wasn’t much of a social person, so didn’t have many distractions. The
    more he worked the more he developed an interest in this work and it soon became a passion of his. Besides for his
    customers he wouldn’t do much socializing.

    After some years, George left the electrician to start his own business. He would work in the day’s and study things
    at night. Whatever would interest him, he would start to learn. One day it was Science, one day it was maths, etc…
    <br>
    One day he received an interesting call, an electrician was needed at the observatory for some maintenance. The next
    day he went down to the observatory and upon seeing the large telescope his interest was piqued.

    He got his hands on many books and started reading, but things just didn’t seem to make sense to him. He read about
    the planets and the stars, but it just did not seem to make sense. He looked elsewhere for information. He found an
    alternat book with different theories about gravity, the planets and the stars. Now this made sense to him. It was
    well formulated and elegantly presented. “Why would it be so hard to find this book first“, he thought. He knew he
    couldn’t trust those universities. Why were they not teaching this? This is the truth.
    <br>
    The more George learned the more isolated he became, he stopped visiting his parents, and soon barely did any
    electrician jobs. The more he dived the more paranoid he became. This was Georges deepest dive into conspiracies.
    <br>
    As some time went by he pulled himself out of this semi-sycosis like phase, with the help of his former boss. The
    years went by and he was able to go back to living a normal life. He worked and continued to learn. But at night,
    when everyone was sleeping he would go back to that book he read so long ago and ask, “Why do they not want the
    world to know the truth?”
